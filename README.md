# Lexi's Alacritty Config
## Installation
### Linux
Make sure `~/.config/alacritty` is either empty or doesn't exist before doing this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/lexis-alacritty-config ~/.config/alacritty
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty/themes
git clone https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme ~/.config/alacritty/themes
```

You will have to install the 0xProto Nerd Font Mono to make it not suck (thats what _i_ use so im forcing _you_ to use it now >:3).

It's at `https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads`.
