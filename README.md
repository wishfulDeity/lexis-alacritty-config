# Lexi's Alacritty Config
## Installation
### Linux
Make sure `~/.config/alacritty` is either empty or doesn't exist before doing this.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/lexis-alacritty-config ~/.config/alacritty
```
### Windows
You're on your own, but this is probably a good start:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/lexis-alacritty-config (full/path/to/alacritty/config)
```
