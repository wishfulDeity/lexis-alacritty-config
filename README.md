# Lexi's Alacritty Config
## Installation
### Linux
Make sure `~/.config/alacritty` is either empty or doesn't exist before doing this.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/lexis-alacritty-config ~/.config/alacritty
git clone https://github.com/catppuccin/alacritty.git ~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes
```

You will have to install the Victor Mono NerdFont to make it not suck (thats what _i_ use so im forcing _you_ to use it now).

It's at `https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads`. Just <C-f> for 'Victor' or scroll wayyy down to the bottom (its like the 2nd to last one)
